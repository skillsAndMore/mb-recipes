# Metabox.io Recipes
This repository collect all the field and blocks created with Metabox.io

I use the term recipe is a custom solution created with Metabox.io framework. I am planning to add them as time goes by and when I have to create a new solution.

The end point is to create a **community driven** reporitory and GitHub Page in order to make it easier download and use the framework.
